            <h2>What is feminist science fiction?</h2>
            <p>
                Feminist science fiction is a genre that possesses the typical characteristics of science fiction literature while also focusing 
                on issues specific to women and gender roles. Sci-fi reimagines the future with advanced technology, dystopian societies, 
                and/or alternate universes. Feminist science fiction contains these typical tropes but through a feminist lens. This often involves
                challenging typical societal gender roles and gendered assumptions through new, imagined universes. The futuristic focus of sci-fi
                lends itself to a reimagined, futuristic focus on gender as well. 
            </p>
            <h2>Why is this genre important?</h2>
            <p>
                This genre is important because it can provide us with new understandings of gender power dynamics in our society and how
                to challenge these systems. Personally, reading literature from this genre has made me think more critically about both
                society and my own beliefs. We all have presumed notions about gender and gender roles. Feminist science fiction can use
                the power of fantasy and alternate universes to help us break away from traditional thinking patterns about these topics. 
                This will at least facilitate conversation towards a more equitable, inclusive future. 
            <h2>Why should I read this genre?</h2>
            <p>
                If you're interested in exciting stories with complex, dynamic characters, this genre is for you! Even if the genre sounds very niche,
                I've found that there's wide variety of literature within this field, so anyone can find something they enjoy. From the 
                very alien, like Octavia Butler's <em>Bloodchild</em>, to the dystopian postapocalyptic, like Lilliam Rivera's 
                <em>Dealing in Dreams</em>: you are sure to enjoy something! Besides for enjoyment, you should also read this genre
                because of the important, relevent topics it touches on. Many of these stories will challenge the way you think about
                current society and what has been normalized. I think it's important for all of us to consider this at least every once in a while.

            <h2>Who are some important authors in this genre?</h2>
            <p>
                Two authors who I think would be great to read for this genre are Octavia Butler and Joanna Russ. Octavia Butler
                wrote the famous story <em>Bloodchild</em>, as well as <em>Parable of the Sower</em> and <em>Kindred</em>. <em>Bloodchild</em> 
                presents a phenomenon of male pregnancy through an alien species. This related pregnancy and bodily autonomy through a male
                character's perspective, and I think this is an especially interesting story to read in the context of modern-day abortion rights issues.
                Joanna Russ is another famous feminist science fiction author in the 1960s. One of her most famous novels, <em>The Female Man</em>,
                contains the short story <em>When It Changed</em>. For me, this story reframed how I thought about gender. While I had previously
                considered in a natural trait, this story made me realize it was an imagined social construct, and this prepared me well for reading
                other works in feminist science fiction.
